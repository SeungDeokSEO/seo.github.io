I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an Illinois Global Institute Language Fellow (Arabic) for the academic year 2024-25. My research focuses on the effectiveness and allocation of foreign aid, as well as inter-NGO cooperation, with a special regional emphasis on Middle Eastern countries, particularly those in the Levant. As part of my research, I conducted surveys and several interviews with representatives and senior staff of Palestinian NGOs.

Previously, I worked as a consultant with UN Women in Palestine and the Korea International Cooperation Agency in their Iraq office. My education has spanned several countries, including South Korea, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, England, Israel, Palestine, and the United States.
